Environment Setup for Your AI Startup:

Get your data operations in top gear! We've deployed Apache Airflow to expertly manage data flow on a Windows platform. For transforming data, we've integrated dbt into a Docker environmentâ€”think of it as a specialized kitchen for refining raw data. This ELT process leads to a structured data warehouse, acting as an organized storage hub. Ready to dive in? Check our references for detailed guidance. Use the following codes to initiate the setup:

# Airflow Installation (Windows):

pip install apache-airflow

# Dockerized dbt Setup:

docker run --network=host -v path/to/dbt/folder:/usr/app ghcr.io/dbt-labs/dbt-postgres:latest
