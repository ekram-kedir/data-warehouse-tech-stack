 # Project Overview:
This project was undertaken as a solo challenge from 10 Academy, aiming to revolutionize urban mobility through innovative technology. As the sole contributor, I took on the challenge of deploying UAVs (drones) to collect and analyze vehicle trajectory data. To achieve this, I strategically integrated key technologies: Airflow for seamless orchestration, DBT for agile and scalable data transformations, and Redash for intuitive data visualization.

 # Key Achievements:

Successfully configured Airflow using Astro CLI and Docker, creating an automated and well-orchestrated data pipeline.

Orchestrated the DBT environment using Cosmos, enabling collaborative and structured data transformations.

successfully setup Redash as a visual interface

 # Challenges Overcome:

Addressed initial hurdles with Airflow DAG visibility through collaborative troubleshooting.
Tackled technical setup challenges, including compatibility issues in a Windows environment and version discrepancies.
Overcame nuanced integration challenges between Airflow and DBT, ensuring seamless alignment.
Areas for Future Enhancement:

Improving DAG visibility in the Airflow web UI for enhanced monitoring and management.
Expanding the development of more comprehensive data models, including predictive analytics and advanced traffic pattern forecasting.
Fine-tuning and optimizing data transformation processes in DBT for increased efficiency.
Note:
This project was a solo challenge from 10 Academy. Given more time, I would have dedicated efforts to successfully settle the integration of Redash, refining the connection between Redash and the data ecosystem.

 # Conclusion:
This README reflects the journey of a solo contributor in tackling the 10 Academy challenge, creating a sophisticated data ecosystem for urban mobility enhancement. As I celebrate achievements and learnings, I look forward to refining and expanding capabilities for future data-driven success.

 # Astro CLI (Airflow)
Start the Astro CLI web server:

astro dev start

This command initiates the Airflow development environment using Astro CLI. Ensure that you have Astro CLI installed and configured with the necessary settings.

 # Stop the Astro CLI web server:

astro dev stop

Use this command to halt the running Astro CLI web server.

 # Cosmos (DBT)
Run DBT models in development:

dbt run
